# Introduction

This is the project of a six-legged walking robot Bullet named after [bullet ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraponera_clavata). The project consists of three repositories:
* [bullet_hardware](http://github.com/dkoguciuk/bullet_hardware) - containing 3D model of the robot done with SolidWorks and schematic and layout of PCB boards done with Eagle Software,
* [bullet_firmware](https://github.com/dkoguciuk/bullet_firmware) - containing a low-level program for STM microprocessor written for one of the PCB boards done with CooCox tool,
* [bullet_software](https://github.com/dkoguciuk/bullet_software) - containing a high-level software for onboard RaspberryPi board done with ROS Framework.

# Usage

You can run hand control of the Bullet robot in gazebo simultor with the following:

```roslaunch bullet_simulator bullet_simulator.launch```  
```roslaunch bullet_kinematics bullet_kinematics.launch```  
```roslaunch bullet_gait bullet_gait.launch```  
```roslaunch bullet_teleop bullet_teleop.launch```
